## Usage
Make sure Node installed. I recommend using [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to manage versions. 

This has been tested on Node `0.12.x` - `5.9.0`, and should work on newer versions as well. [File an issue](https://github.com/vigetlabs/gulp-starter/issues) if it doesn't!

#### Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

#### Run development tasks:
```
npm start
```
Aliases: `npm run gulp`, `npm run development`

This is where the magic happens. The perfect front-end workflow. This runs the default gulp task, which starts compiling, watching, and live updating all our files as we change them. BrowserSync will start a server on port 3000, or do whatever you've configured it to do. You'll be able to see live changes in all connected browsers. Don't forget about the additional BrowserSync tools available on port 3001!

#### Build production files:
```bash
npm run production
```
## Asset Task Details
A `README.md` with details about each asset task are available in their respective folders in the `src` directory:

- [JavaScript](src/javascripts)
- [Stylesheets](src/stylesheets)
- [HTML](src/html)
- [Fonts](src/fonts)
- [Images](src/images)
- [Icon Font](src/icons#iconfont-task)
- [SVG Sprite](src/icons#svg-sprite-task)
- [Static Files (favicons, app icons, etc.)](src/static)

## Additional Task Details

### Build production-ready files
```
npm run production
```

This will compile revisioned and compressed files to `./public`.

### Run JavaScript Tests
```
npm run test
```

#### Run in tests in watch mode:
```bash
npm run test:watch
```
Test files located in `__tests__` folders are picked up and run using
[Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.12/index.html), [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/), [Chai](http://chaijs.com/), and [Sinon](http://sinonjs.org/). The test script right now first compiles a production build, and then, if successful runs Karma. This is nice when using something like [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/vigetlabs/gulp-starter) in that if an error occurs during the build step, Travis alerts me that it failed. To pass, the files have to compile properly AND pass the JS tests.
